Founded on October 15, 1885, at DePauw University, our organization has advanced the intellectual, social, and moral culture of its members. Alpha Chi Omega is a place where unique and genuine women find strength in numbers, supported by sisters who encourage them to be their real selves, network for their dream jobs, and give back to their community. Through a variety of philanthropic and social activities, the UCSB chapter upholds these values by inspiring its members to adopt important qualities such as empathy and ambition, demonstrating excellence through academic success and character development.</p>
        <p className = "about-paragraph">This is a place where real, strong women find connection, foster a community of support, and embrace opportunities while surrounded by those who encourage them to chase their passions and value them for who they really areâ€” and want to become.</p>
