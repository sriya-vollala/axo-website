        <><p className = 'pres-note'>Welcome to Alpha Chi Omega at UCSB!</p>
        <p className='pres-note'>My name is Alexa Gonzalez, and I have the incredible honor of serving as Chapter President of Alpha Chi Omega. Our chapter is built on a foundation of genuine sisterhood, personal growth, and a shared commitment to making a positive impact both on campus and in the Santa Barbara community.</p>
        <p className='pres-note'>One of the most meaningful parts of our chapter is our dedication to our national philanthropy: Domestic Violence Awareness. This cause is deeply important to us, and we are proud to partner with Domestic Violence Solutions of Santa Barbara. Through service events, awareness campaigns, and fundraising efforts, we work to support survivors and bring education and advocacy to our community. It’s a reminder that being a member of Alpha Chi means using our voices and actions to create real change.</p>
        <p className='pres-note'>Beyond philanthropy, our sisterhood is at the heart of everything we do. Alpha Chi is a space where members can be their most authentic selves—celebrated for their individuality and supported through every season of life. Within this sisterhood, we share laughter, traditions, and countless memories, but also a bond rooted in encouragement and growth. Whether it’s cheering each other on in academics, showing up for campus involvement, or simply being there in everyday moments, the strength of our sisterhood is what makes Alpha Chi Omega so special.</p>    
        <p className='pres-note'>Community service and campus involvement are also essential parts of who we are. Our members are leaders in student organizations, volunteers across Santa Barbara, and advocates for causes close to their hearts. We believe that being part of Alpha Chi means not only investing in yourself but also giving back to the world around you.</p>        
        <p className='pres-note'>As Chapter President, I’ve experienced firsthand how Alpha Chi empowers women to grow into confident leaders, compassionate friends, and engaged community members. This sisterhood has shaped me in ways I could never have imagined, and I’m so proud to be part of a chapter that embodies strength, purpose, and unity.</p>
        <p className='pres-note'>We’re so glad you’re here, and we invite you to explore our website to learn more about what makes Alpha Chi Omega at UCSB truly one of a kind.</p>
