        <><p>Hiiii! My name is Alexa and I’m a second-year Biology major on the pre-med track. 
            Being Chapter President has been one of the best experiences I’ve had during my time in Alpha Chi. 
            I’ve made so many new friendships and learned so much about myself and others. 
            Holding a leadership position was something I knew I wanted from the moment I joined AXO. 
            Seeing the impact past officers had on our members inspired me to do the same. 
            It’s an experience I wouldn’t get anywhere else, and I’m so grateful to Alpha Chi for giving me that opportunity.</p>

            <p>Getting involved in our chapter has helped me build deeper connections not just within Alpha Chi,
                but also across the greater Greek life community. I want to encourage everyone to step out of their 
                comfort zones and try something new. It can feel scary, but it’s incredibly rewarding and truly 
                life-changing. You never know how much you’ll grow or who you’ll meet until you put yourself out there.</p></>
