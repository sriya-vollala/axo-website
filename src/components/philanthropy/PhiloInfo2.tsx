        DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH (DVAM) - DVAM is recognized 
        nationally during the month of October. To fight against unhealthy 
        relationships and build healthy relationships, Alpha Chi Omega headquarters
         provides a number of opportunities for members to highlight their service 
         to individuals and families impacted by domestic violence, to educate 
         themselves and others about healthy relationships, and to raise awareness 
         of the cause.

        HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WEEK (HRW) - The goal of Healthy Relationships Week 
        is to foster the development of healthy relationships and, in turn, prevent 
        domestic violence and sexual assault. The week traditionally focuses on 
        encouraging individuals to define what love means to them through the 
        Love Is… campaign. The week's programming is open to all and includes social
         media posts and an educational program or resources. Healthy Relationships
          Week is celebrated in the month of February around Valentine’s Day.

        SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH (SAAM) - April is national Sexual Assault 
        Awareness Month. To recognize this month, Alpha Chi Omega provides 
        opportunities and digital resources for education and awareness initiatives
        focused on sexual assault prevention in partnership with RAINN 
        (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network). During this month, members also 
        support the victims and survivors of sexual assault by wearing denim, creating 
        a jean display or hosting an event on campus with educational information to 
        promote awareness.
