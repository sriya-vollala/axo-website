        In support of our national altruism, Alpha Chi Omega 
        members are dedicated to raising awareness and educating 
        others about domestic violence. 
        </p>
        <p className="phil-info">
        The 1992 Alpha Chi Omega National Convention marked the adoption 
        of domestic violence awareness, an issue that affects people – and 
        primarily women – all over the world, as our national philanthropy. 
        Together, we work to fight against unhealthy relationships and build 
        healthy relationships. Members serve individuals and families impacted
        by domestic violence through fundraising and sharing gifts of time and talent 
        with shelters and other service-providing organizations. Alpha Chi Omega also 
        works to empower its own members, giving them tools to build their own healthy 
        relationships, and to raise awareness of domestic violence by educating others 
        on its impact and work being done to end it. 
        </p>
